# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. The understainding gained from this concise visualization will help PyBer's executives make decisions to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Results 
The following data was obtained though the analysis
### A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

### Total Fare by city type chart from January to April 2019

key findings from the above data:
- Urban cities have the highest ride demand, suburban cities has less and rural cities have the least.
- In terms of number of driversUrban cities have about 5 times more drivers than suburban cities which in turn has more than 6 times the number of rural cities.
- However, the ratio of rides per number of drivers is highest is rural cities, followed by suburban cities then urban cities are the least in that ratio.
- Also, average fare per ride and driver is highest in rural city  followed by suburban cities then urban cities. 
- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides. 
- The graph per month shows a slight increase in fares as months go from Winter to Spring in 2019, but it's not a significant increase.

## Summary

### Findings and coerrelation between different factors: 
- It appears that the ratio between ride demand and number of drivers drivers up the average fare per ride or per driver. In rural cities where this ratio is highest the drivers can expect the highest fare rate, followed by suburban cities then urban cities. 
- The above result can also be due to the fact that rural cities are more geographically sprawled which makes each trip there much longer than suburban and urban trips which leads to the higher per ride fare.

### Recommendations
- Increase the per mile rates in urban cities since drivers are not earning as much per ride as their suburban and rural colleagues.
- Create inventives for more drivers to work in rural and suburban areas to maximize the market share in these highly profitable areas
- Plan to temporarily hire a small percentage of additional drivers as the warm months sees a slighly higher ride demand.
